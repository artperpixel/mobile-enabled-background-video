Thanks for reporting an issue. Sticky-kit is actually pretty complicated and
handles a lot of sticky scenarios. If the issue isn't immediately obvious when
written in text then you must include a minimal case example of the problem on
<http://jsfiddle.net/> or something similar to help save us some time.

Thanks

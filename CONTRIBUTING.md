# Contributing to mobile-enabled-background-video

Thanks for reporting an issue. Mobile-enabled-background-video is so new born. If the issue isn't immediately obvious when
written in text then you must include a minimal case example of the problem on
<http://jsfiddle.net/> or something similar to help save us some time.

Thanks
